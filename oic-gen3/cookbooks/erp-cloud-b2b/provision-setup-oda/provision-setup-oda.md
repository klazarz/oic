# Provision Oracle Digital Assistant

## Introduction
Oracle Digital Assistant is a platform that allows enterprises to create and deploy digital assistants for their users. With Oracle Digital Assistant, you create:

- **Digital assistants**, which are AI-driven interfaces that help users accomplish a variety of tasks in natural language conversations. For each digital assistant, you assemble one or more skills

- **Skills** (formerly known as chatbots), which are individual bots that are focused on specific types of tasks, such as tracking inventory, submitting time cards, and creating expense reports

You can add skills to digital assistants or deploy them to a channel on their own.

**Basic Concepts**
Before you dive into digital assistant and skill development, here are some concepts you’ll want to get familiar with:

- **Intents**: Categories of actions or tasks users expect your skill to perform for them

- **Entities**: Variables that identify key pieces of information from user input that enable the skill to fulfill a task

Both intents and entities are common **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** concepts. NLP is the science of extracting the intention and relevant information from text.

- **Components**: Provide your skill with various functions so that it can respond to users. These can be generic functions like outputting text, or they can return information from a backend and perform custom logic

- **Dialog Flow**: The definition for the skill-user interaction. The dialog flow describes how your skill responds and behaves according to user input

- **Channels**: Digital assistants and skills aren’t apps that you download from an app marketplace, like iTunes. Instead, users access them through messaging platforms or through client messaging apps. Channels, which are platform-specific configurations, allow this access. A single digital assistant or skill can have several channels configured for it so that it can run on different services simultaneously

Estimated Time: 15 minutes
