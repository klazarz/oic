# Enable File Server and setup connections

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the process of enabling the Oracle Integration 3 File Server. By default, the File Server is not enabled, but is required for this workshop. Also, you will be setting up required connections for designing your integration flow in the later lab exercises.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Enable File Server.
* Configure FTP folders and permissions
* Connect to File Server using FTP Client
* Setup connections using adapters


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Successfully provisioned Oracle Integration 3 Instance and able to access the home page.

## Task 1: Enable File Server

- An administrator must enable File Server before an organization can start using it with their Oracle Integration instance. Enabling File Server is a one-time action in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console

    If your organization hasn't enabled File Server yet, and you select File Server from the navigation pane, the following message appears: *Start sharing files...*

    ![File Server Not Enabled](images/fileservernotenabled.png =50%x50%)


    To enable File Server:

1. On the Oracle Cloud Get Started page, select the region in the upper right where you created your Oracle Integration 3 instance. Open the navigation menu in the upper left and click *Developer Services*. Under **Application Integration**, click *Integration*.
2. If needed, select the compartment where you created your Oracle Integration 3 instance. You should see your instance.

3. Select your instance.
   The Integration Instance Details page is displayed.
4. Click the *Enable* link for File Server on the Integration Instance Information tab.

## Task 3: Connect to File Server with FTP Client

To access files on the File Server you will need to use an FTP Client. You will need to configure your FTP Client with the following:

* File Server IP Address.
* File Server Port.
* Your Oracle Integration username.
* Your Oracle Integration password.

1. To obtain the File Server IP Address and Port, select **Settings** from the left Navigation pane. The IP and Port are located in the *IP and Port Information* section of the *Settings* page.

2. Using your FTP Client choice, connect to the File Server using the SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol.  
If the permissions are configured correctly, you should be able to list, read, and write files on the *B2BTPDELLOut* folder.

## Task 4: Import supporting lab artifacts

There are some artifacts which are made available so that you can focus on the core part of the usecase. [Download](https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/p/ErOK2_XFjuwyvJYosDbgtXTBTwPUDCvDzr-iaG6-3aw_KSHxZrWTq5LjiYsNA3-v/n/oicpm/b/oiclivelabs/o/oic3/erp-cloud-b2b/oic-ocw-artifacts.zip) the lab artifacts and unzip in any local directory.

1.  Navigate to **OIC console** and Select *Design* &gt; *Packages*. Select *Import* action and browse for the *oic.ocw.hol.par* package under **Import** folder.
    ![Import Integration Package](images/import-supporting-package.png)
Select *Import and Configure*. This will open the *Configuration Editor*
    ![Open Config Editor](images/config-editor-show.png)
    The package consists of 2 Connections and Integration flows
    **Connections**
    - REST Interface
    - ERP Cloud
    **Integrations**
    - Change Order ERP PO Proxy - Integration updates PO information
    - Purchase Order Details Proxy - Integration gets PO details given an Order Number and Legal Entity

2.  *Edit* the **REST Interface** connection and click on *Test*.

3.  Similarly, *Edit* the **ERP Cloud** connection and provide the following information and click on *Test* and wait until you receive a confirmation box that the test was successful.

    | **Field**  | **Values** |
    |---|---|
    |ERP Cloud Host | `<your-erp-host-name>` |
    |Security Policy | **Username Password Token**|
    |Username | `<erp-username>`|
    |Password | `<erp-password>`|
    {: title="ERP Cloud Connection Properties"}

    Finally,*Save* the connection

4.  In the **Configuration Editor**, Select *Activation* in the title bar which brings up the **Review and Activate** section. Hover on the **Change Order Proxy Integration** and Select *Activate*.
![Activate Package Integrations](images/activate-package-integration.png).
    Select the *Tracing* level as **Debug** and click on *Activate*.
    Similarly, activate the **Purchase Order Details Proxy** Integration. Both Integration status turns to **Active** status, which indicates the integration is ready to accept requests.

## Task 5: Create Connection with File Server

To access the File Server from an Integration, you will need to create an FTP Connection.  

1. In the left Navigation pane, click *Design* &gt; *Connections* &gt; click *Create*
2. In the *Create Connection* dialog, select the **FTP** adapter to use for this connection. To find the adapter, enter FTP in the search field. Click on the highlighted adapter
3. From the **Create Connection** dialog, *Name* your connection as **File Server** and leave the rest of the configurations as default. Click *Create*.  
    > **Note:**  If you get an error that the identifier already exists, enter unique connection name and remember this name for use later in the workshop.

4. Enter the following configurations in the *FTP Connection* with the information you previously gathered from the File Server Settings page.  
  | Field                   | Value                                                 |
  |-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
  | FTP Server Host Address | From File Server Settings - IP and Port Information   |
  | FPT Server Port         | From File Server Settings - IP and Port Information   |
  | SFTP Connection         | Yes                                                   |
  | Security                | FTP Server Access Policy                              |
