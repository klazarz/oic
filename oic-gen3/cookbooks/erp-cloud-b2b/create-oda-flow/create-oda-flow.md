# Create ODA Conversation Flow

## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, the ability to seamlessly interact with and gain insights from complex processes is a significant advantage. Oracle Integration, with its powerful capabilities, enables the creation of streamlined workflows that automate and optimize critical business to business operations. In this tutorial, we're about to embark on a journey that goes beyond automation â€“ we'll explore how Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA) can be seamlessly integrated to elevate your Purchase Order (PO) management to new heights.

Imagine a scenario where you've already mastered the creation of a dynamic PO change order workflow using Oracle Process Automation (OPA). Now, take it a step further: picture having an intelligent conversation with your application to inquire about purchase details and status. That's precisely what we'll achieve through the integration of Oracle Digital Assistant.

Estimated Time: 40 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will create a skill that can be used for interactions with a ERP Cloud, to check the Purchase Order Details and Status. As part of this process, you will:
* Define intents, utterances, entities.
* Design a conversation flow by using the Visual Flow Designer.
* Validate, debug and test your skill.

### Prerequisites

42. Click on **Transitions** tab and Select **Next Transition** as *callERPAPI*
  ![Reenter Transition](images/reenter-transition.png)

43. Your final conversation flow should look as below:
    ![PO Conversation Flow Final](images/final-flow.png)

44. Next, go head and click on the **Main Flow** tab under the **Flow Designer** section. we need to map the conversation design flow the appropriate intents for that you need to create an **Intent Event Handler**. In the Main flow window expand the **Intent Events** section and click on the **+** icon besides it. A window opens up for mapping the Intent with the appropriate mapped flow, make sure to match **Greetings** Intent with **Greetings** mapped flow and hit the **Create** button.

   ![Map Intent to PO Flow Add](images/map-intent-to-flow.png)

   ![Map Intent to PO Flow ](images/map-intent-to-flow-po.png)

45. The final mappings should look like below. With this you have successfully designed the conversation flow for Purchase Order Assistant, you can now proceed to the next Task.

   ![Final Intent Mappings](images/final-mappings.png)

## Task 4: Test your Skill

In this section we will just test the happy path scenario of the conversation dialogue flow we built in the previous section.

  1. Click on the **Validate** button on the top to make sure there are no errors.

     ![validate](images/validate.png)

  2. Then click on the **Preview** button to Test the bot.

     ![preview](images/preview.png)

  3. **Conversation Tester** window opens up and in the **Type Here** section type "Hi" and hit enter, the bot should respond with a Greeting message as shown in the screenshot below.

     ![conversation-tester-hi](images/conversation-tester-hi.png)

  4.  Then enter the sentence **Purchase Order Status** and hit enter, you should see the bot asking for you to enter the "Order Number " as below:

     ![conversation-po](images/conversation-po.png)

  5. Then enter the order number created as part of previous lab and then click on **Yes** the bot returns with details of the order number and asks if you would like to check status of another order number,  click on **No** to see the bot responding with "Thank you" message.
