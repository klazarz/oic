# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, we shall talk about provisioning Oracle Integration 3 instance, provisioning Oracle Autonomous Database and then how to create connections for REST API which complies with Open API 3.0 specification. You will learn how to create an integration flow that exposes REST Interface and consumes OAuth enabled REST API. In the bonus lab, you will learn how to secure OIC Integration Flow with OAuth.

Estimated Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

### What is Oracle Integration 3?

Integration is a fundamental part of your digital business development. It involves connecting on-premises applications and cloud applications and services. Oracle Integration makes it easy to connect your applications and automate end-to-end processes such as procure to pay, inquiry to order, and hire to retire.

Critical business processes, such as those related to human capital management (HCM), customer experience (CX), and enterprise resource planning (ERP), are frequently slow and inflexible. For example, a multi-step process such as Lead to Opportunity to Quote to Order can involve four or more applications and require human exception management at every step of the process. In this scenario, the lack of integration between departments as well as the delays caused by human-based problem resolution can result in lost revenue, frustrated customers, and high costs.

Oracle Integration changes all that. It empowers you to:

  - Establish connectivity between the many applications and people that are part of the entire business process life cycle.

  - Assemble existing technologies into new business services to better align with the changing pace of new business demands.

  - Deliver new business innovations faster by rapidly connecting diverse applications and key business roles.

  - Gain 360-degree views across your entire business. Easily monitor and analyze every application, integration, and workflow spanning the business process life cycle.
